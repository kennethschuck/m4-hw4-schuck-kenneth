  <h2>History</h2>
  <h3>Where did Doja Cat come from?</h3>
  <article>
  <p>Doja Cat has been making music and posting it on Soundcloud since as early as 2012.
    But her rise to fame did not really accelerate until 2018 when she released her single called "MOOO!" which brought her
    to the coveted status of being a meme. Memes are the best way to promote music in the age
    of Generation Z. With the rise of TikTok, her easily accessible, catchy, pop-rap-r&b fusion
    took the world by storm.
